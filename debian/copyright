 Hi David
 .
 thanks for taking on the packaging for Debian. Mostly, the
 documentation is in pod format and already in the distribution (within
 latexdiff and latexrevise, and latexdiff-vc), but there is a separate
 .tex file as well.
 Below is the snippet from my internal Makefile that prepares the
 distribution (in directory dist) and I attach latexdiff-man.tex. All
 the other files needed should be in the distribution (but the paths
 will need adapting).
 .
 I note your comments regarding version numbering, and also will see
 that I include the latexdiff-man.tex file in the next release on CTAN
 but I have been rather busy of late, so the next release is not
 imminent.
 .
 Regards
 Frederik
